# python-api-challenge
This project contains weather analysis of randomly selected cities across the globe and uses OpenWeatherMap API to find the weather information. It depicts the scatter plots for latitude and differnt weather parameters like maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. Linear regression is used to find the correlation between differnt parameters and analysis is added at the top of WeatherPy notebook.<br>

The second part of the project finds cities with suitable weather condition for a vacation and hotels in those cities. It uses Google places API with nearby search request. A heatmap is added inidcating the humidity across the cities and have marked hotel information for the cities suitable for vacation.<br><br>
All the scatter plots and heatmaps are saved in the folder OutputData.
